A good part of our youth was spent around the campfire and we still love everything about summer camp! Melissa enjoyed many summers as a camper, camp counselor and lifeguard while Gaby spent his summers as a camper, counselor and head counselor. We have a long family tradition of selling gear for kids going to summer camp. Melissa's parents, \\\"Murray the Sockman\\\" and Meryl have been running the store \\\"Kosher Socks\\\" for the past 40 years, a \\u201Cone-stop shop\\u201D for everything you need for summer camp. Located in South Fallsburg, NY, the store is still a hub of activity every summer. Murray and Meryl also pioneered the \\u201Ccamp sale\\u201D model, in which they partnered with schools in the greater NY area and sold camp products on-location, with a percentage of sales going to the school. Murray always dreamed of taking the store online and bringing the \\u201Cone-stop shop\\u201D camp model to a wider audience. In 2017, we realized that dream and launched the online store, Pack for Camp, revolutionizing the way parents shop for camp. We know how difficult and time consuming it can be to fill your camp packing list. We use our experience from the store combined with modern technological innovations to make your shopping experience as quick, easy, and enjoyable as possible.

I ordered clothing labels for my children for camp, they seem like great quality and they stayed on perfectly in the laundry. I was able to find all sorts of odds and ends that my children need for camp on their website. I got my order really fast. The customer service is amazing, they answer emails right away and are very helpful. I definitely will be ordering again from them.\\\" Chumi Rubin \\\"We received our order today and were very, very, pleased!...When I think of all the price shopping I did on other items I had already bought, It would have been so much more pleasant to simply order it all from you and still feel good about the prices.
